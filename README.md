# üìà Stock Vision AI

**Stock Vision AI** is an AI-powered platform for **real-time stock market analysis and future price prediction**. It utilizes a **pre-trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** deep learning model to forecast stock prices based on historical time-series data. The application is built with **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface and fetches **live stock data** from **Yahoo Finance**, enabling users to visualize market trends and make informed decisions.

## üìå Key Features

1. **Real-Time Stock Data Fetching**  
   Fetch live stock prices for any publicly listed company using its ticker symbol and a custom date range.

2. **Historical Price Visualization**  
   Graphical visualization of past stock trends using interactive line charts.

3. **LSTM-Based Prediction Model**  
   Uses a pre-trained LSTM model to generate accurate stock price forecasts without re-training on every execution.

4. **User-Friendly Web Interface**  
   Built using Streamlit for ease of use and accessibility across devices.

5. **Modular Design**  
   Includes separate components for data loading, preprocessing, model loading, and plotting for easy maintenance.

## üîÇÔ∏è Project Overview

- A centralized dashboard where users can input stock symbols and date ranges to visualize both historical and predicted prices.  
- The application loads a **pre-trained LSTM model** (`stock_model.pkl`) to predict future stock trends without additional training.  
- Data preprocessing includes scaling, reshaping, and applying time-series modeling techniques to ensure accurate predictions.  
- Results are displayed in a user-friendly graph that overlays actual historical data with predicted values.

## üß† LSTM Model Insights

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequential data like stock prices.  
- The model was trained using features like Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.  
- Predictions are generated by feeding in the most recent historical data, and output values are reverse-scaled for real-world interpretation.

## üìà Visual Interface

- The interface includes:
  - Input boxes for **stock ticker symbol**
  - Date range selectors for **start and end dates**
  - Graph showing **actual vs predicted stock prices**
- Visual outputs help users easily interpret past and forecasted performance trends.
